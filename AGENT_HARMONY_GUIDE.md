# OlyBars Dev Team: Antigravity & Jules Synergy

Welcome to the future of development. You now have two specialized AI agents at your disposal. Here is how to use them for maximum efficiency on OlyBars.com.

## 1. The Delegation Model

Think of **Antigravity** as your **Pair Programmer** (Active & Local) and **Jules** as your **Staff Engineer** (Asynchronous & Background).

| Task Type | Best Agent | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UI/UX & Aesthetics** | **Antigravity** | I can see your Tailwind styles, typography, and Lucide icons in real-time. I "get" the Oly Navy and Gold vibe. |
| **Local Debugging** | **Antigravity** | I have direct access to your terminal logs and can run browser tests to verify fixes on the spot. |
| **Artie Persona** | **Antigravity** | I am grounded in the Artie "Well 80" lore and LCB compliance rules. |
| **New Features (Boilerplate)** | **Jules** | Give Jules a high-level spec in a GitHub Issue. Jules will build the backend services, types, and logic in a clean Cloud VM. |
| **Unit Test Coverage** | **Jules** | "Write unit tests for the venue service" is a perfect task for Jules to run asynchronously while you work on something else. |
| **Maintenance & Bumps** | **Jules** | Library migrations, fixing linting errors across the repo, and version updates are Jules' bread and butter. |

## 2. Recommendation: The "Handover" Workflow

1.  **Plan with Antigravity**: Use me to draft a technical spec or an `implementation_plan.md`.
2.  **Execute Breadth with Jules**: Copy the spec into a GitHub Issue and assign it to Jules.
3.  **Refine & Polish with Antigravity**: Once Jules submits a Pull Request, bring those changes into your local workspace. I will then help you with the "OlyBars Polish"—ensuring the UI feels premium and the Artie persona is perfectly tuned.

## 3. Practical Example

**You want to add a "Voucher System":**
- **Antigravity**: "Help me design the Firestore schema and implementation plan for the new Voucher system."
- **Jules**: "Following this plan [link], build the `VoucherService.ts` and ensure 100% test coverage."
- **Antigravity**: "Jules finished the service. Now, help me build the React component for the Voucher display with a high-end glassmorphism look."
