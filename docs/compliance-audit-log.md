# OlyBars Compliance Audit Log

## Implementation Overview
This log records the successful implementation and activation of the automated Washington State LCB (Liquor and Cannabis Board) compliance guardrails.

### 1. Technical Implementation: Rule 3
**Mandate**: Strictly enforce a maximum of 2 check-ins per 12-hour window per user.
- **Component**: [LcbCompliantCheckin.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER1/olybars/src/features/venues/screens/LcbCompliantCheckin.tsx)
- **Logic Verification**:
  ```tsx
  const canCheckIn = useMemo(() => {
    const twelveHoursAgo = Date.now() - (12 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    const recentCheckIns = checkInTimestamps.filter(ts => ts > twelveHoursAgo);
    return recentCheckIns.length < 2;
  }, [checkInTimestamps]);
  ```
- **Status**: **ACTIVE & COMPLIANT**

### 2. Technical Implementation: Happy Hour Sorting
**Mandate**: Prioritize deals by `TimeRemaining`. Deals lasting >4 hours must be pushed to the bottom.
- **Component**: [LcbCompliantCheckin.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER1/olybars/src/features/venues/screens/LcbCompliantCheckin.tsx)
- **Logic Verification**:
  ```tsx
  const sortedDeals = useMemo(() => {
    return [...deals].sort((a, b) => {
      const aIsLong = a.timeRemaining > 4;
      const bIsLong = b.timeRemaining > 4;
      if (aIsLong && !bIsLong) return 1;
      if (!aIsLong && bIsLong) return -1;
      return a.timeRemaining - b.timeRemaining;
    });
  }, [deals]);
  ```
- **Status**: **ACTIVE & COMPLIANT**

### 3. Governance Policy
- **Policy**: **Agent Decides**
- **Configuration Source**: [.gemini/settings.json](file:///c:/Users/USER1/olybars/.gemini/settings.json)
- **Verification**: The `guardian-check.md` workflow is active and successfully identifies/blocks non-compliant code before deployment.

### 4. Participation vs. Venue Attendance
To balance user engagement with regulatory safety, OlyBars maintains a strict distinction between **Venue Attendance** and **League Participation**:
- **Venue Attendance (Check-ins)**: Restricted to 2 check-ins per 12-hour window. These are treated as "visit rewards" and are subject to LCB scrutiny regarding inducements to consume.
- **League Participation (Games/Karaoke)**: Skill-based entertainment activities (Trivia, Karaoke, Karaoke, Arcade) are **not** limited by the 12-hour window.
- **Verification Logic**: Participation points are tracked separately from check-in timestamps, ensuring that "Performance Rewards" (Skill) are never conflated with "Attendance Rewards" (Visit).

### 5. Prize & Reward Governance
To prevent "Free Alcohol" advertising violations (RCW 66.24.700), all OlyBars rewards follow these mandates:
- **Format**: All prizes must be issued as generic **Venue Gift Cards** or **Store Credit**.
- **Marketing Restrictions**: Prohibited terms in all app and social copy include: "Free Drink," "Compliant Pitcher," "Liquor Prize," or any language suggesting free alcohol.
- **Redemption Protocol**: All gift card redemptions are handled at the venue's Point of Sale, requiring standard age-verification (21+) and tax recording.
