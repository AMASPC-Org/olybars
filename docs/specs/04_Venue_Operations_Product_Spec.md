# 04 – Venue Operations & Command Center

## 1. The Owner Value Prop
Bar owners are busy and tech-averse. The dashboard must be "Zero-Click" intelligent.
* *Motto:* "We don't give you data; we give you answers."

## 2. Feature Set: The Command Center

### 2.1 The "Bat Signal" (Promotions)
* **Problem:** Slow Tuesday night.
* **Solution:** One-tap "Flash Deal."
* **Mechanism:** Owner selects "Activate Happy Hour." Artie pushes a notification to all League Players within 2 miles: *"Flash Deal at The Brotherhood: $1 Rainier until 9pm."*
* **Constraint:** Limited to 1 push per week per venue to prevent notification fatigue.

### 2.2 The Intel Deck (Analytics)
* **Traffic Heatmap:** "You were 20% quieter than neighborhood average tonight."
* **Demographic Vibe:** "Your crowd tonight is mostly 'Explorers' (New customers)."
* **Feedback Loop:** Aggregated sentiment from Vibe Checks (e.g., "People are tagging 'Lively'").

### 2.3 Profile Management (SSOT)
* **Single Source of Truth:** Owners update hours/specials here.
* **Sync:** Updates reflect immediately in the Player App and Artie's context.

## 3. Operational Security
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * *Owner:* Full Admin.
    * *Manager:* Can toggle "Buzz" status and open/close tabs.
    * *Staff:* Read-only or simplified "Vibe Reporter" view.

## 4. Onboarding Flow
1.  **Claim:** Owner finds venue in public database.
2.  **Verify:** Phone verification / postcard verification code.
3.  **Setup:** 3-step wizard (Confirm Hours, Upload Menu Photo, Set "Vibe Tags").
