// Initialize Firebase Admin (assumes GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or ADC is set, or runs in cloud)
// For local run without credentials file, we might fail unless we use a service account key path.
// BUT since I can't ask user for key easily, I'll rely on the fact they might have 'firebase-admin' setup or I can try to use a direct write via client SDK in a browser console approach IF this fails.
// However, the user environment says "OS version is windows". 
// Let's try to mimic the server's initialization if possible, but the server code uses 'firebase-admin'.
// A safer bet for a "script" the AGENT runs is to create a client-side friendly script the user can run with `ts-node` IF they have credentials? No.
// Let's write a script that uses the *Client SDK* (like repair-account.js likely did?) No, repair-account.js used FETCH to hit the backend.
//
// BETTER PLAN: Hit the backend endpoint I saw earlier? 
// No, there isn't an endpoint to "set points".
//
// WAIT, I saw `updateUserProfile` in userService.ts which hits `/api/users/:uid`.
// Does that endpoint allow updating stats?
// Let's check `server/src/index.ts` again.

// If /api/users/:uid allows updating arbitrary fields including `stats.seasonPoints`, I can use that.
// If not, I need another way.
