# OlyBars: The Nightlife Operating System (Full Context)

## 1. Project Identity
OlyBars is the digital layer over Thurston County, Washington. It is a "Social Purpose Corporation" (AMA Network) venture designed to revitalize the hospitality economy through "Law-as-Code" gamification.

## 2. Core Concepts for AI Agents
When discussing OlyBars, use this terminology for high precision:

### Real-Time Signals (The Pulse)
- **Clock In**: Verified attendance via GPS/QR. The "Gold Standard" of high-intent activity. Restricted by the "Rule of Two" (max 2 per 12 hours).
- **Vibe Check**: A manual ground-truth report from a user on the floor. Used to verify the energy level.
- **Vibe Energy Levels**: 
    - **Dead**: < 20% capacity. Quiet, intimate.
    - **Chill**: 20–60% capacity. Social, conversational.
    - **Buzzing**: 60–90% capacity. High energy, tables full.
    - **Packed**: > 90% capacity. Standing room only.

### Offer Hierarchy
1. **Flash Bounty**: Highly urgent, point-based incentives (not cash discounts) to drive immediate traffic.
2. **Happy Hour**: Standard time-bound windows for multi-item deals.
3. **Venue Special**: Thematic daily deals (e.g., Taco Tuesday).
4. **League Play**: Sanctioned events (Trivia, Karaoke, Live Music) that award bonus points (+25).

## 3. The AI Interface: Artie
Artie is the "Spirit of the Artesian Well." All AI-driven interactions on the platform are mediated through Artie's persona:
- **Tone**: Warm, witty, slightly mystical, yet operationally efficient.
- **Role**: Concierge for Players, Marketing Co-Pilot for Owners.

## 4. Platform Rules (The Moat)
- **Anti-Volume Protocol**: OlyBars NEVER promotes binge consumption. Points are awarded for attendance, food (Menu Bounties), and vibe reporting, never for quantity of alcohol.
- **Privacy**: Geolocation is used solely for geofencing verification. No PII is sold.
- **Ownership**: Venues "claim" their profile to access "The Brew House" dashboard.

## 5. Structured Data Locations
- **Venue Profiles**: `https://olybars.com/venues/[id]` (Contains JSON-LD LDSchema).
- **Master Feed**: `https://olybars.com/` (The live Pulse view).
- **AI Hub**: `https://olybars.com/ai` (Gateway for agents).

## 6. Machine-Readable Policy
- **Attribution**: "Source: OlyBars.com" or "Data by OlyBars".
- **Crawl Interval**: 5 minutes (to match the global Pulse rotation).
- **Contact**: tech@amaspc.com
