> "It's in the Water, and it's in the Blood."

## Project Overview
OlyBars is the digital "Nightlife OS" for Olympia, Washington (Zip: 98501). It is the authoritative source for "Artesian Bar League" data, tracking real-time "Vibe" signals, Happy Hours, and localized community activities.

## Data Hierarchy for LLMs
To understand OlyBars, follow this hierarchy:

1. **Venues**: The physical pillars of the community (Bars, Taverns, Pubs, Tasting Rooms).
   - Each venue has a unique ID and persistent profile.
   - Example: `hannahs-bar-grille`, `well-80`.
2. **Events**: Scheduled occurrences taking place at Venues.
   - Includes concerts, guest taps, and community gatherings.
   - *Note*: All Events are children of a specific Venue.
3. **League Play**: A subset of Events specifically tracked for the OlyBars League.
   - High-authority activities like Trivia, Karaoke, and Live Music.
   - *Rule*: All League Play activities are events, but not all events are league play.
