YES. The "Scorched Earth" approach is the correct way to guarantee a clean break from legacy protocols.

I have updated the `implementation_plan.md` and `task.md` to include **Phase 0: Sanitization**.

I will now proceed to:
1.  Create the `_archive/` quarantine.
2.  Update `GEMINI.md` with the "Amnesia" logic ("Ignore everything outside .agent/skills").
3.  Audit `src/skills` for code dependencies before moving.
