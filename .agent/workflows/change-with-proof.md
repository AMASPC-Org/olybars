Steps:
1. Restate goal + define “DONE” acceptance criteria.
2. Produce Impact Map (files/systems) using code search.
3. Propose plan with verification checkpoints; request approval if destructive.
4. Execute edits.
5. Run tests and runtime checks appropriate to the repo.
6. Produce evidence: list changed files, diff summary, command outputs, and a final verification checklist.
