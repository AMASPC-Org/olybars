# Design-First Trigger

IF a request involves >1 file or architectural changes (e.g., "Add Auth", "Create Skill"):
1. **STOP.** Do not write code yet.
2. **Draft a TDD**: Create a Technical Design Document outlining the Goal, Architecture, and Steps.
3. **Wait for Approval**: Ask the user "Does this plan look correct?" before writing code.
